JavaScript files inside this folder are used only as a convenience way of
loading multiple modules, "array.js" will load all the modules inside the
"array/" folder, "math.js" loads all the "math/" modules and so on.

**Documentation for each module will be on a README file inside each folder.**

For usage examples check specs inside `/tests` folder. Unit tests are the best
documentation you can get...
